# Linux-Fundamentals-Part-1
A walkthrough of my learning on TryHackMe in the first of 3 rooms dedicated to learning the Linux OS. (https://tryhackme.com/r/room/linuxfundamentalspart1)

<h2>Description</h2>
This introductory TryHackMe room focuses on running basic commands on a Linux terminal, interacting with the file system, and understanding users and groups in Linux. Although it uses Linux Ubuntu, unlike other TryHackMe rooms which have a full Ubuntu desktop environment, this room deploys a Terminal only.

<h2>Utilities Used</h2>

- <b>Terminal</b> 

<h2>Environments Used </h2>

- <b>Linux Ubuntu</b>

<h2>Project walk-through:</h2>

- <b>Running Your First Few Commands</b>
<p>The first 3 tasks of the Linux Fundamentals 1 room provide background information about Linux and instructions on how to start the virtual machine to do the exercises. Now that I have read through that information I'm ready to start learning some commands.</p>
<br>
<p align="center">The first two commands taught in this room are "echo" and "whoami". To output the text "TryHackMe" I used the command echo TryHackMe. <br/>

The text reads tryhackme@Linux1:~$ echo TryHackMe on the first line and below that a line which reads TryHackMe. Finally the last line reads tryhackme@Linux1:~$"/>
  <br />
  <br />
  Next, I used whoami to discover that the machine is logged in as user tryhackme. <br />
